<P><B>How To Be Different</B>. Why to be different? you always see
people here and there moving in the same way and rarely you see
someone who think and move in different ways that may or may not let
him reach his destination but by any means he thought differently. 
</P>
<P>So why to be different when you risk failure, you forgot something
you risk also great success as you will move in a totally new way
that nobody dared to take, you will open new ways, you will be a
leader and after all you will move faster as you are somehow alone.
You might find it dark, muddy, full of obstacles and totally new but
you might find it also flat, shiny, no obstacles and full of
entertainments, that&rsquo;s why it's called risky, so do you dare to
take the risk? 
</P>
<P>Most people don't trust such things and don't dare to take the
risk because clearly they don't like to get out of their comfort
zone, you want to be different and take the risk you have to be a
risk taker. 
</P>
<P>A recent study shows that taking the risk will most probably reach
you to a place you havn't been before. 
</P>
<P>It is said that if you want to see what you never saw move in ways
you have never moved in. 
</P>
<P>It is also said that &quot;No risk no fun&quot; we always have
said it while playing cards in college time. 
</P>
<P>So you are grieving to be different, lets head to the points

	<LI><P><B>Move in different ways</B>: You
	might think what ways should I move on, do you mean real ways while
	I am driving my car, go into different businesses to gain money or
	some new life style that nobody did, I meant all of them 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Read about people who moved
	differently</B>: An ancient quote says &quot;Wolves eat lonely
	lambs&quot; and another recent quote says &quot;fall and fall again
	till lambs become loins&quot; you see? them if you are a lamb wolves
	will eat you but loins are always alone and they are the jungle
	kings so by any means you will find someone that you will relate to
	while being different, someone that is different too and moved in
	the same way, so being different is all about knowing what different
	people did and be one them in your way. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Dare to try</B>: Sorry to tell
	you, but cowards are left behind, you might have your own
	commitments towards your family, you society, your friends, your
	work but you still have time for yourself that you don't manage
	quite good, <A HREF="/time-management-skills/how-to-manage-your-time-effectively">managing
	your spare time</A> is one of the most effective ways if you want to
	try new things, you should read new books, join new courses, try new
	things and even travel to somewhere totally new, this way you will
	be different. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Believe in yourself that you can change the world</B>: I
	small website, that seems small but reach millions of people per
	month will definitely change your world financially, personally and
	educationally, you can begin <A HREF="http://www.strongerstudents.com/success/how-passion-leads-to-success">writing about anything you
	like deeply inside your heart</A>, write about food, sports,
	electronics, psychology, education or any other thing.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Feel free</B>: life
	constrains are one of the most destructive things you can ever face,
	in the beginning of your life, you were so ambitious and you wanted
	to do many things, and while the time goes by, this ambitious soul
	start shrinking and shrinking because your resources are small
	enough not to acquire these wants, what if you trans-change your
	resources to acquire all your wants, will being different help you
	do this? Think about it.</P>
	</OL>
	<P>In short, being different is
	all about being yourself, search about your true self, the true
	meaning of your life, we all are born different to have different
	roles in life, not to be all the same, everyone of us have different
	DNA, different fingerprint and different personality, apply this in
	your life and your life will definitely change, trust me.</SPAN></P>
	<P>In my book <A HREF="/The-Ultimate-University-Guide">The
	Ultimate University Life</A> I explained exactly what college is
	meant to be, as it meant to be as life so this book is talking a
	life experience that will help you with your university life and
	beyond, feel free to subscribe to the newsletter or the free exam
